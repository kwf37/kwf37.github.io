Area, energy, and critical path were fairly striaghtforward to evaluate, but performance of a routing network is very difficult to characterize. It is entirely data dependent, and it is also important to look at starvation and fairness issues. We ended up visualizing worst-case latencies for every source/destination pair in our router, which helped us discover some major fairness issues."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Critter World"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"My first introduction to software engineering.
