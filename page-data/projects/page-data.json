My partner Joyce Huang and I took a work-in-progress 2D mesh generator from Professor Christopher Batten's research group and augmented it to evaluate the performance of three types of router microarchitectures on a 4x4 mesh with various traffic patterns. The RTL was generated through PyMTL. The full report can be found here.</p>\n<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>\n<p>Evaluation can often be the hardest part of a project. Area, energy, and critical path were fairly striaghtforward to evaluate, but performance of a routing network is very difficult to characterize. It is entirely data dependent, and it is also important to look at starvation and fairness issues. We ended up visualizing worst-case latencies for every source/destination pair in our router, which helped us discover some major fairness issues.</p>\n<h2>Critter World</h2>\n<p>My first introduction to software engineering. Over the last two months of my first semester at Cornell, my partner Olivia Xiang and I worked on a cumulative project for CS 2112 (Honors OO Programming) called Critter World. It involved implementing the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A parser and pass framework for a small \"critter language,\" which serves as the DNA of each critter. Each critter is spawned with a program written in \"critter language,\" and during the actual simulation of Critter World, each critter's program will be run to determine its next action.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A simulator for the Critter World. The Critter Wrold was a grid of hexagons that could have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An arbitrary number of critters with different critter programs. These critters can navigate the world and attack each other.</li>\n<li>Rocks that block critter movement</li>\n<li>Food for the critters to consume to grow bigger and stronger.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 04, 2019","path":"/projects","title":"My first blog post"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
